I got curious about the simplifications and abstractions that we collectively inflicted on neurological models of the brain in order to arrive at what the "neural networks" we use for deep learning today. I'm making my way through a textbook called [Principles of Neurobiology](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neurobiology-Liqun-Luo/dp/0815344945/), by Liqun Luo. Along the way, I'm documenting the facts that I find most surprising and divergent from how artificial neural networks work.
